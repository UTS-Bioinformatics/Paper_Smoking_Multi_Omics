# A Comprehensive Multi-omics and Functional Study of Evolutionary Adaptive Responses to Smoke

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code used in the study:

**“A Comprehensive Multi-omics and Functional Study of Evolutionary Adaptive Responses to Smoke”**

The code supports data processing, statistical analysis, and figure generation across
multiple omics modalities, including transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics,
epigenomics, and ChIP-seq–based analyses, with a focus on smoking-related biological
responses.

## Data availability

This repository primarily contains **analysis code**.

Public datasets used in this study are available from the original sources cited in the
manuscript, including GEO accessions such as:

- **GSE237252** (NORM bulk RNA-seq)
- Other public datasets as referenced in the manuscript

Due to size, privacy, or licensing constraints, raw data are **not fully hosted** in this
repository. Where applicable, processed or example files are provided to illustrate
workflow structure.

## Code availability

All code required to reproduce the analyses reported in the manuscript is provided in
this repository.

A stable version corresponding to the submitted manuscript is archived as a GitHub
**release** (see Releases tab).

---

## Software requirements

Analyses were performed in **R**, using a range of CRAN and Bioconductor packages.
Specific version requirements are documented within individual scripts where relevant
(e.g. legacy package compatibility).

For full reproducibility, users are encouraged to consult script headers for
package dependencies and version notes.
